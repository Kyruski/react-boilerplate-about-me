      "text": "I’ve always been interested in problem solving, computers, and coding from a young age. I went to summer schools/camps for coding starting at age 10, took a class in java during high school, and was always interested in puzzle games like sudoku; but then I went down a different path for college. It led me to starting my PhD in Biology, but during that time, the other PhD students and I would always have talks about “What we’d be doing if we didn’t go into the Biology field.” One said a PhD in a different field, one said a truck driver, but I was always convinced I would’ve gone to college for Computer Science. My curiosity for pursuing computer science/software engineering as a career choice grew, and I decided to take a leap of faith. I took a leave of absence from my PhD, and took a stab at this coding thing.\n I started coding about 40hrs a week with no real direction, until I entered a boot-camp. This is where I got a lot of focus into the direction of my studies. Coding became calming and therapeutic for me, and I developed a hunger for learning new techniques, technologies, and frameworks. Additionally, coding is very fulfilling as it brings about these small feelings of accomplishment whether it be due to solving a small bug or just adding some small functionality and seeing the fruits of your labor. While I was at the bootcamp, I went above and beyond because of my hunger, teaching myself Typescript, PostgreSQL, TravisCI, Electron, and more.\n I have since built apps with a focus on micro-service architectures, optimizing database seeding, querying, and server response times, as well as a proof-of-concept desktop app.",
